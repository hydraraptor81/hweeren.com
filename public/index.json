I do not collect any personal information or track you using cookies, collect your fingerprints or use any tracking scripts.\nYour Privacy is of utmost importance to me. This policy explains how I handle your information.\nHosting Provider I use Cloudflare for domain registration, DNS for my domain hweeren.com. Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Tunnel is only used for www.hweeren.com and all other services listed here do not used Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Tunnel unless otherwise stated.\nI do not have access to your IP addresses or activity logs. Cloudflare does keep logs of your website visits in accordance with their privacy policy.\nOther Software I use Hugo to build our website. Hugo has additional privacy settings for GDPR compliance, and I configure it to be as privacy friendly as possible.\nSearXNG Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy is effective as of 1 February 2025 and subject to change as the policy is still a work in progress.\n1. Logging Policy I will never log your search queries, user agent information or your unmasked IP address. Your IP address will only be logged if it is on a known blocklist. These firewall logs are rotated periodically.\nI also use the inbuilt SearXNG rate limiter which keeps a SHA256 hash of a salted IP address for a maximum period of 10 minutes, solely for operational purposes. You can review the Source code of the rate limiter yourself.\n2. Cookies and Local Storage I use cookies only to improve your experience, like saving your preferences. I will never use these to track you and I will never use third-party cookies. You can see your saved cookies in Preferences.\n3. TLS Termination I always handle TLS termination ourselves and never use third-party services such as Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Lambda, etc. This way your search queries are encrypted from your browser to my servers.\nI use my own network to provide you with the best possible experience.\n4. Changes to Privacy Policy I may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be prominently posted on this page, and it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to check for updates on a regular basis.\n5.
