This is my personal blog where I will discuss about Privacy and Security in general. From time to time I will also write op-eds on pretty much any topic under the sun. Do reach out to me if you would like to discuss or contribute to any of my posts! If the matter is sensitive, please use my PGP key on [**keys.openpgp.org**](https://keys.openpgp.org) to communicate with me via email, alternatively I am available on Matrix/Signal though I am online on signal more regularly at [**hydraraptor81.96**](https://signal.me/#eu/jGxZQZHdIY6RGCJd9WyOtGM7iJeNpg_d3sPWyYLBhrfOrcHRgNtElJNIlP9pgWvs)
