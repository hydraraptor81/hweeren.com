This is my personal website. I do not collect any personal information or track you using cookies, collect your fingerprints or use any tracking scripts.

Your Privacy is of **utmost importance** to me. This policy explains how I handle your information.


## Hosting Provider

I use Cloudflare for domain registration, DNS for my domain **hweeren.com**. Cloudflare's Tunnel is only used for [**www.hweeren.com**](https://www.hweeren.com) and all other services listed here do not used Cloudflare's Tunnel unless otherwise stated.  

I do not have access to your IP addresses or activity logs. Cloudflare does keep logs of your website visits in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). 

## Other Software

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build my website. Hugo has [additional privacy settings](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) for GDPR compliance, and I configure it to be as privacy friendly as possible.

## SearXNG Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 1 February 2025 and subject to change as the policy is still a work in progress.

### 1. Logging Policy

I will **never log** your search queries, user agent information or your unmasked IP address. Your IP address will only be logged if it is on a known blocklist. These firewall logs are rotated periodically.

I also use the **inbuilt SearXNG rate limiter** which keeps a **SHA256 hash of a salted IP address** for a maximum period of **10 minutes**, solely for operational purposes. You can review the [**Source code**](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/blob/master/searx/botdetection/ip_limit.py) of the rate limiter yourself.

### 2. Cookies and Local Storage 

I use **cookies** only to improve your experience, like saving your preferences. I will never use these to track you and I will **never** use third-party cookies. You can see your saved cookies in **Preferences**.

### 3. TLS Termination

I always handle TLS termination myself and never use third-party services such as Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Lambda, etc. This way your search queries are **encrypted** from your browser to my servers. 

I use my **own network** to provide you with the best possible experience.

### 4. Changes to Privacy Policy

I may **update** this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be **prominently posted** on this page, and it's up to you to **check for updates** on a regular basis.

### 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection, please contact me via email at [**hr@hweeren.com**](mailto:hr@hweeren.com)
