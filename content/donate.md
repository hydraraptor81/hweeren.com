The domain costs me US$10.44/year or S$14.18/year (Singapore Dollars) to renew from Cloudflare. This repository is hosted on Github for free. It costs me about S$21.33 in electricity to maintain the SearXNG instance and other services that I host for myself.

I am not doing well financially as of the date of writing and I would appreciate if anyone is willing to donate to maintain my SearXNG instance. If I receive any more than needed to maintain the instance, I will donate it to [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/donate) a privacy and security focused mobile operating system that I depend on daily. Do feel free to donate to them instead of myself as the costs of maintaining the server is trivial over the long run anyways.
